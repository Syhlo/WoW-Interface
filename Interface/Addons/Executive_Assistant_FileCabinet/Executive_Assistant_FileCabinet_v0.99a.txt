Executive Assistant is a configurable Task (To-Do) List that lets you manage your game-time efficiently.
File Cabinet lets you back up all that work.


Version Notes:
	v.99a
		Altered the "Make Backup" button's text to be more direct in what the user should do (and so it's harder to confuse the popup with a tootip descriptor)
